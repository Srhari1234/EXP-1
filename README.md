AIM: to install Visual Studio Code and writing a program to print hello world, and calculator program

Theory: VS code is a code editor that, with the appropriate extensions, can run all types of programs and codes. In the codes, MinGW is used to add the c++ extension printing hello world uses the "cout" character output, and the calculator program uses the arithmetic operators sum(+), difference(-), multiplication(*), and division(/).

CODE1:

#include<iostream>

int main(){
std::cout<<"Hello World";

return 0;
}
